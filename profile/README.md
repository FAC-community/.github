# Welcome to Founders and Coders

This organisation is a work in progress. There are some resources here that you might find useful if you are thinking of joining our Foundation programme. We meet on Tuesday evenings during term time. For more information, see [our website](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/learn/).

1. Our [Intro workshop](https://github.com/FACapplicants/intro-workshop). Start here.
2. A [Planning workshop](https://github.com/FACapplicants/planning) that we worked on together in October 2024. You might want to work through the first three steps in a pair.
3. If you want to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, take a look at [these 80 concepts and syntax elements introduced in a hello.html page](https://github.com/FACapplicants/planning/blob/main/hello.md), that was originally created for the planning workshop.
4. Once you are ready for it, we strongly encourage you to use the meetups to pair program on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) kata.
