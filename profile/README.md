# Welcome to Founders and Coders

This organisation is a work in progress. There are some resources here that you might find useful if you are thinking of joining our Foundation programme.

1. Our [Intro workkshop](https://github.com/FACapplicants/intro-workshop). Start here.
2. A [Planning workshop](https://github.com/FACapplicants/planning) that we worked on together in October 2024. You might want to work through the first three steps in a pair.
3. If you want to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, take a look at [these 80 concepts and syntax elements introduced in an hello.html page](https://github.com/FACapplicants/planning/blob/main/hello.md), that was originally created for the planning workshop.
